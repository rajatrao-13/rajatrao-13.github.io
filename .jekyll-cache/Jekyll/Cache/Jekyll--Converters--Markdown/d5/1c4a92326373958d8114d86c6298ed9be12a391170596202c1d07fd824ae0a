<p>On enumerating different services of Monteverde machine, we were able extract list of users available in the target machine. Due to security misconfiguration, one of the users has set the password same as the username and this was identified by brute forcing the same using smb_login module from metasploit. Levering the misconfiguration, we were able to login to <strong>SMB</strong> with the help of smbclient and on further enumeration, we were able to extract a file named <code class="highlighter-rouge">azure.xml</code> under <code class="highlighter-rouge">mhope</code> user folder consisting of credentails of the same user. Making the use of credential found, we were able to get Windows Remote Management shell with the help of tool named <code class="highlighter-rouge">evil-winrm</code> which targets on port 5985 port. Here, we were able to get basic shell and were able pwn the â€˜user.txt` part of the challenge. M</p>
