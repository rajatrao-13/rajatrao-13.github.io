<p>Â  Â  On enumerating different services of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ServMon</code> machine, we were able to find few confidentail files from <code class="highlighter-rouge">FTP</code> service which disclosed a hint saying that a file consisting of passwords being stored in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Nathan</code> users desktop. On exploring port 80, we were able to discover a Network Surveillance Management Software i.e. <code class="highlighter-rouge">NVMS-1000</code>. Assessing the software, it was vulnerable to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Directory Traversal</code> vulnerability which helped us to conquer the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Passwords.txt</code> from <code class="highlighter-rouge">Nathan's</code> desktop by using exploit available on exploit-db.As we have got a list of passsword and two usersnames ( <code class="highlighter-rouge">Nathan</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Nadine</code> ), we try to brute force the available <code class="highlighter-rouge">SSH</code> service on target machine using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hydra</code>. Brute Forcing helped us to find credentails of <code class="highlighter-rouge">nadine</code> and taking leverage of it, we sshâ€™ed to the machine using <code class="highlighter-rouge">nadine</code> cracked password and get <code class="highlighter-rouge">user.txt</code>. Once we got the local access, enumeration helped us to find <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSClient++</code> running and on exploitation of it using publicly available script, we were able to get maximum level of privelege and get <code class="highlighter-rouge">root.txt</code>.</p>
